# DWA-Project01

Project 1 for HES Course CSCI E-15 "Dynamic Web Applications"<br>
## Project Description

For this small, proof of concept project, you will create a single page website that displays the following information:

* Your name
* A photo of yourself. If you have privacy concerns about putting a photo of yourself online, you can use an alternative image (of your pet, a cartoon, whatever).
* A brief paragraph introducing yourself (what do you do, what brings you to this course, etc.). I'll be compiling a list of P1s to share with the course so note that this information will be public.
* A random quote generated with PHP.
